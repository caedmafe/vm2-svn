These are the build scripts for VirtueMart
You will need them to build installable archives out of the SVN sources.

=== Download + Extract Apache Ant ===
==============================
You need to install  Apache Ant in order to build the archives.

You can download the latest version of Apache Ant here:
http://ant.apache.org/bindownload.cgi

=== Available Ant Tasks ===
========================
There are two basic tasks, which will create different package editions

	* one for building the COMPLETE PACKAGE
		( Task Name: virtuemart_complete )
		
	* one for building the Manual Installation Package
		( Task Name: virtuemart_manual_installation )

Both tasks will create the Language Pack and a Version for Joomla! 1.0.x/Mambo and one for Joomla! 1.5.

==== Adjust the file config.properties ====
=================================
Open the file "config.properties" (should be in the same directory as this HOWTO file) with a Text Editor.
Change the value for "svn.dir" to point to your local checkout copy of the VirtueMart Trunk (SVN).

Example: 
###
svn.dir					= C:/joomla/VirtueMart/svn/virtuemart
###
where "C:/joomla/VirtueMart/svn/" is the directory that contains the trunk ("build_scripts", "documentation", ..., "virtuemart" )

=== Run Ant on the command line ===
=================================
1. Now you need to open a terminal (on Windows: [WindowsKey] + R, then type "cmd").
2. Change the current working directory to your SVN/build_scripts directory
	> cd C:\joomla\VirtueMart\svn\build_scripts
	
3. Run Ant and specify the target (Complete Package or Manual Install Package)
	> "C:\Program Files\apache-ant\bin\ant.bat" virtuemart_complete
	You will then see some messages being printed on the command line.
	
4. When everything went ok ([BUILD SUCCESSFUL]), you should now have a new directory "dist" (if you haven't changed the patch name for the dist.dir variable) 
	which contains the installable files.
