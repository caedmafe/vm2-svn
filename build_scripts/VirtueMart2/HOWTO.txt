For each installer, the Phing tokens included in some files are replaced with their property values.
1. Removes all folder from a previous installer with the same version  number
2. Export from the repository all files in the same folder as the build file
3. Creates the com_virtuemart installer.
4. Creates the languages installer. The xml file is automatically updated and included for each language.
